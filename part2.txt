2- Explain 3 different CSS selectors.

a) ID selector: they're special because no two attributes can have the same ID value within a conformant document. (E.g: #top).
c) Type selector: represents an instance of the element type in the document tree (E.g: ul).
c) Pseudo-classes: It provides selection based on information that lies outside of the DOM. (E.g: a:hover).

3- What is the difference between SessionStorage and LocalStorage in HTML5?

localStorage has no expiration time, it's available until explicitly deleted from the browser's cache.
sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends, it's only available on the browser's window.
